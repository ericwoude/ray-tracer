# Simple Ray Tracer
![Demo 1 picture](img/demo_1.png)

An implementation of a basic ray tracer following Ray Tracing In One Weekend [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html).

Outside the scope of the book, I added:
- multithreading
- triangle rendering

## Usage
1. Configure the project and generate the native build system, and call the build system to compile and link the project:
```bash
$ make build
```
The compiled executables will be placed in build/bin.

2. Invoke the ray tracer and output the results to a file
```bash
$ ./bin/raytracer > image.ppm
```
