# Simple Ray Tracer

An implementation of a basic ray tracer following Ray Tracing In One Weekend by Peter Shirley [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html).

Outside the scope of the book, I added:
- multithreading
- triangle rendering

## Usage

1. Configure the project and generate the native build system:
```bash
$ cmake -B build
```

2. Call the build system to compile and link the project
```bash
$ cmake --build build
```
The compiled executables will be placed in build/bin.

3. Invoke the ray tracer and output the results to a file
```bash
$ ./bin/raytracer > image.ppm
```
